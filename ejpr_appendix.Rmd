\section{Setup of the conjoint experiment}


\textsc{Invitation}\\

\textit{Dear participant,
GESIS, the largest European infrastructure institute for the social sciences, conducts a survey on political preferences and how they relate to voting. The survey lasts approximately 5 minutes. The data will only be used for scientific purposes.\\
We thank you very much for your participation and for your time!}

\textsc{Instruction} \\

\textit{Now we would like to show you the profiles of potential candidates for entering the parliament in [country's] national parliamentary election. Please take your time when reading the descriptions of each candidate.}\\

\textit{You will be shown eight screens with different candidates and their policy proposals. We would like to know, \textbf{based on your preferences}, which one of the two candidates you would vote for in the next [country's] national parliamentary election. 
People have different preferences on these issues, and there are no right or wrong answers.}

\textsc{Questions}\\

\textit{If you had to choose between them \textbf{based on your preferences}, which of the two candidates would you vote for?}

\begin{itemize}
Candidate 1}
Candidate 2}
\end{itemize}

\textit{Independent of your choice, how would you rate each of the candidates described above? Please rank each candidate overall on a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates that you strongly disapprove of the candidate and 7 that you strongly approve of the candidate.}

\section{Selection of issues and levels for the conjoint experiment}

* Most important issue question bar charts
* Facebook topic salience 

```{r PRRV vs nonPRRV and most important issue, }

df <- readRDS("../Data/ejpr_data.Rds") # survey with parties data

# All countries, Wave 1: PRRV vs, nonPRRV
